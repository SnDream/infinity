Tom,

It was nice meeting you.  I want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to show you our game, Infinity.  Over the weekend, we corrected a few bugs and we're ready to send the ROM to the evalutaion team.

Please have somebody reply to this so I know where to send the file.

Thanks again!

Sincerely,
Justin Karneges
