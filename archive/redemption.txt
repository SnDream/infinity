THE PAST

Fade in, a wizard, a woman, and a knight.

Wizard: You must kill us.  It is the only way.
Knight: I cannot...
Woman: Please, understand my love.  If we live, HE lives.
Knight: I cannot...
Woman: You must.  Let my love guide your hand.

Fade to black.  Sound of two slashes.  Fade back in, the wizard and the woman are dead.  Fade to black.

"God forgive me."

THE FUTURE

Fade in, two knights (one in red, one in gold) stand face to face in the snow at a castle's gate.  Both have weapons drawn.

"Time moves forward, taking us like leaves in the wind... 
We meet, we brush against each other, and then fall to the earth... 
Longing for the days when we shared a branch together... 
Longing for the spring... 
But all things end..."

THE PRESENT

Fade in, a man is in bed...he is the gold knight seen earlier.  There is a knocking sound heard.  He gets up, goes downstairs, finds a guard at his door.

The player is HERO, a knight who was cast out in disgrace by his king for promoting a policy of kindness toward the northern neighbors, the Aluthans.  The king has called him back, however, requesting that HERO aid him, for the Aluthans seem to be massing an army for war, and the King wishes for HERO to attempt to dissuade the Aluthans from this course.  In the castle, HERO encounters THE CREATOR, who is producing golems for the Selerans (that is, HERO's people) to use to dominate their enemies.  HERO returns to the castle at midnight to speak to the king again.  It is revealed that ANNA, HERO's wife, died in a plague two years earlier.  ANNA was an Aluthan.  The king apologizes for his treatment of the Aluthans and says that age has made him realize that hatred should be a passing thing.  HERO agrees to perform the final mission, but for ANNA's memory, not for the king.  He learns that he must go through North Pass.  North Pass, however, cannot be navigated easily without a guide.

In the town (Selera) he meets a guide named RYAN.  RYAN agrees to take him through the pass, though he warns there is a monster that has killed everyone who has tried to go through.  HERO pays him, and the two go to North Pass.  They face a werewolf, which they dispatch.  RYAN, saying his job is done, leaves.

The hero next  passes into Kassim Oasis, a desert village.  He then is obstructed by the Fire Caves.  To pass through them, he must purchase water in Kassim Oasis with which to extinguish the flames.  In the caves, he meets a strange wizard (The Wadji GUTANA) in a fire cave who he dispatches with the aid of an apprentice from the Wizard's Tower.  The apprentice, ELYA, explains that the evil fire wizard was an apprentice gone mad.  ELYA also states that he is going north to examine a huge magical surge of energy that the Wizards detected.

They enter Turren, a town on the edge of the Great Forest.  The town is deserted.  Below the town (they get in through the well) they find the townspeople in hiding.  Apparently a disease of lycanthropy has come to the town.  The town's best guide, VICTOR, was struck ill. He turns into a werewolf, but is still sane enough to guide them through the wood.

In the wood, they find EVIL TREE, an singing entity which was responsible for the lyncanthropy.  Dispatching EVIL TREE does not return VICTOR to his normal form.  ELYA explains that lycanthropy may only be reversed by a powerful spell, which he is incapable of performing.  ELYA explains that the Wizards at the Wizard's Tower might be able to help.  VICTOR joins them on their continued path.  ELYA enigmantically explains that the Earth is "remembering evil" and that explains the appearance of the Evil Tree and the monsters.  Dispatching EVIL TREE cleared away roots that were blocking the exit from the forest.

They come to where the town of Holbrooke once stood.  The town has been completely annihilated.  In the ruins, ELYA senses great magical residue.  He says the source of the spell is to the north.  In the north lies Durgardt, which guards the entrance into Alutha. The three go to Durgardt.  In Durgardt, they are surrounded by guards, but just before battle commences, ROLAND, the red knight from the begining, steps forward and tells them to stop.

HERO calls ROLAND brother, but ROLAND rebuffs him, claiming that he lost the right to call him brother when ANNA died.  HERO says he loved her, ROLAND says that she died because he took her to Selera, where there was a plague.  ROLAND says he has waited two years for them to duel and that one must die.  HERO asks if there is any other way, ROLAND says there is not.

They duel, ROLAND wins.  He spares HERO, however, telling him that he wishes to send a message to the king of Selera.  He shows ROLAND the GEIST CANNON.  He has a prisonner brought forward into the GEIST CANNON.  The prisonner dies, the GEIST CANNON fires a bolt of fire that destroys a small forest south of where Holbrooke stood.  ROLAND warns HERO that Selera will be next if the SOUL GEM is not given to him.

Fades back into Selera, where HERO explains to the king the situation.  As they speak, the castle rocks with an explosion.  A guard rushes in, saying the castle is under attack.  The guard rushes out of the room.  The king asks the guard where the golems are, the guard says they are the very force attacking the castle!  The king realizes they are betrayed and tells HERO to enter his bedroom and take the SOUL GEM.  He says there is a secret passage which will lead them through the sewers and out of Selera.

As the party enters the room, the screen scrolls back to the king.  The castle rocks again and the screen pans to the door to the room.  It opens, and THE CREATOR walks through.  He and the king exchange threats, the screen pans back to the door, shows the party in the room.  The castle shakes and a scream is heard.  They quickly take the Soul Gem and flee into the sewers.

In the sewers, ELYA flies into a rage at the mention of golems.  He explains that they violate the essential tenet of Wizards, that life shall not be created.  HERO asks why, ELYA reveals that creating life causes death.  That to create so many golems, a huge number of people must have been killed.  He asks when the golems came.  HERO realizes that the plague was caused to create the golems and has a vendetta agains the CREATOR.

Passing through the sewers requires that they flip switches to drain the water from certain regions.  As they exit, the face a sewer lizard that has grown to immense size.  They dispatch it.

Upon exiting, they see that the GEIST CANNON is employed against Selera, destroy the town and the castle.  A boat stops along the shore near Selera, and out steps RYAN.  He says that they look like they're in need of help, and in exchange for all of their money, he will take them away from Selera.  They agree out of neccessity.  RYAN drops them in Fairport, a port city.  All of the ships in Fairport are gone, however, because the dread pirate RED ARROW captured them all.  The party seems trapped on the island.

Exploration, however, reveals the pirates the lair.  After passing through the lair, they discover that RYAN is indeed RED ARROW, and they force him to return the captured prisoners and ships to Fairport.  They now have access to RYAN's boat, which ELYA insists they use to return to the Wizard's Tower.

RYAN drops them at the island, promising to wait with the boat.  Immediately after the party disembarks, he sails off.  The party goes to the Wizard's Tower.  ELYA attempts to explain the situation, but no one believes that a weapon such as the GEIST CANNON could exist.  ELYA, to gain their trust, decides to complete his training.

He commences the WIZARD'S TRIAL.  Alone, he navigates a magical dungeon.  Solving it requires figuring out a number of puzzles.  At its end is an evil creature.  At last the secret of why no apprentices have become full Wizards is revealed.  ELYA dispatches the creature, gains new powers, and speaks to the ARCHMAGE.  He is horrified at the creature in the Tower, and now believes ELYA's story.  They insist, however, that they must stay and guard the Tower.  They reverse VICTOR's lycanthropy, however, and he gains new skills.  HERO gives the Soul Gem to the Wizards for safe keeping.  It is revealed the Creator was once named KRAITH and was a Wizard who was exiled for attempting to create life, which violates the fundamental law of Wizards.

They are in the Tower, not sure how to continue.  VICTOR wishes to return home.  As they leave the Tower, RYAN shows up with the boat.  He takes them as close to Turren as he can. Inspection of Turren, however, shows that the town is totally deserted and the cavern beneath is filled with werewolves.  They were too late to stop Evil Tree's spell.  Only the Mayor remains human.  He says that most of the townspeople ran into the Forest when they turned.  The Mayor turns into a werewolf and is dispatched.

The party leaves Turren, and returns to find the boat, but it is gone.  VICTOR refuses to enter the Forest, so they go south through the Fire Caves to Kassim Oasis.

In Kassim Oasis they find the Aluthan army.  They have been routed.  It is revealed that the golems, since they are not living things, are immune to the GEIST CANNON.  ROLAND is found in the town.  He and HERO meet, and he bitterly says that they are all about to die.  The golems arrive.  ROLAND joins the party and they fight many waves of golems.  Eventually, they are overwhelmed.  They are forced to flee into the Fire Caves, leaving behind the GEIST CANNON.

They now pass back into the Forest, which is now filled with werewolves.  They exit it and see that the river south of the Forest has been dammed, creating a ford.  They go to Durgardt.  The fortress is empty of soldiers, and has many corpses.  Golems attack them.  They find that the golems have overtaken them by damming the river.  Desperate, ROLAND urges them on to Alutha.

To reach Alutha, they travel over the Mountain Pass.  The Mountain Pass is extremely windy, and must be navigated carefully.  A Yeti guards the exit.

Alutha has repelled the golem attack.  The party visits the king and tells him of the routing of the Aluthan army.  THE CREATOR arrives and offers to spare the lives of everyone in the castle if they will leave Alutha peacefully.  The king refuses and golems attack. The golems drive the party back to the throne room, but then leave.  They discover that the golems raided the crypt and took the body of Alutha, founder of the nation.

(Brief bit of backstory: the reason that the Selerans had conquered and persecuted the Aluthans is because in "ancient times," ALUTHA betrayed SELERA and GILUS, who founded the Wizard's Tower.  When they all went into the Great Dark to kill the UNNAMED, only ALUTHA emerged, despite the fact that all three were alive when the UNNAMED was defeated.)

The king of Alutha reveals a secret given to his line alone.  ALUTHA killed the others because he alone could withstand the curse the UNNAMED lay upon them.  The Selerans and Wizards were too long lived and would eventually fall under his sway.  He says that in truth, Selerans and Aluthans should be at peace, but now both people have been massacred by the war.  He promises to keep Alutha safe, but charged the party with stopping the Creator from killing any more people.

ELYA suggests that they go to the Wizard's Tower.  As they leave the castle, RYAN shows up once more.  Though HERO suggests that RYAN shows up like a vulture, RYAN claims that he was forced to leave them before because of storm conditions.  He offers to take them to the Wizard's Tower free of charge.

The find the Wizard's Tower has been struck by the GEIST CANNON, the one weapon strong enough to pierce its defensive spells.  They enter the tower and fight many golems on the way to the top, where the CREATOR dispatches the ARCHMAGE.  He takes the SOUL GEM and teleports away.  The ARCHMAGE, dying, explains that though the bodies of SELERA and GILUS were lost when the Great Dark tumbled into the sea, the body of ALUTHA, if brought back to life using the Soul Gem, contains enough of the UNNAMED that he will be brought into being once more.  He further explains that the CREATOR will need to use the spell at the island which arose after the Great Dark fell into the sea.  The ARCHMAGE dies.

The party must now visit the three Temples raised by the ArchMage to retrieve the final three Gems necessary for surviving the CREATOR's Geist Cannon.  In each of these Temples they face a unique challenge.  In the Temple of the Sand, they also meet up with HASSAN once more.

The party takes RYAN's boat to the island.  They arrive, but are too late.  The Creator uses the Soul Gem and ALUTHA's body.  The UNNAMED comes and mocks the CREATOR as a fool.  He destroys all of the golems and leaves.  The CREATOR, realizing his horrible mistake, confesses that he planned to use the UNNAMED as a source of infinite power, so that he could take over the world.  He realizes then that the UNNAMED is too strong for him to control.  Though ROLAND and HERO wish to kill him, the CREATOR reveals that there is only one way to defeat the UNNAMED.  If the party were to go back in time from that exact spot, they would appear in the Great Dark at the same time that the old heroes went to kill the UNNAMED.  If they then killed ALUTHA before he could leave, ALUTHA's body would never be available in the present.  Grudgingly, the Party agrees.  Only three may go.  VICTOR is left behind to guard the CREATOR. 

They travel back and traverse the Great Dark, facing difficult enemies.  Finally, they find ALUTHA.  He calls their stories lies, and insists that he must return to make sure people stay vigilant against the UNNAMED.  It is clear that he and ROLAND look alike.  In the end, they are forced to kill him.  He dies saying, "Selera..."

There is a flash of light, and HERO finds that he is trapped in Selera, in the Joyous Day.  The Joyous Day is a time-space paradox where those who are outside of the space-time continuum are sent.  In his Joyous Day, he is in Selera with his wife, ANNA, before she dies.  Strangely, a shadow begins to fall over the Joyous Day, and everyone is terrified.  HERO investigates, and finds a strange hole in reality.  He leaves ANNA, promising to return when he discovers what is happening.

He finds himself in ROLAND's Joyous Day.  This Joyous Day is in Alutha, and ROLAND and ANNA are children.  Grearter darkness has fallen on this day.  He takes ROLAND with him through a third portal, this time into ELYA's Joyous Day.

This Joyous Day is fully vanished.  It is simply a great darkness.  ELYA explains that the UNNAMED has come to the Joyous Day.  They must face him and destroy him there, outside of space and time.  They battle the UNNAMED, and as they do, they see the ghosts of the original three heroes around them.  They dispatch the UNNAMED, which creates another portal. Realizing there is no returning (there is no portal from before) they pass through this final portal.

Fade in to HERO lying in bed, just as in the first fade in.  There is a knock on the door.  He gets up, confused.  "Is this a dream?" he wonders.  "Is this another Joyous Day?"  He goes to the door and in walks ANNA.  They embrace.

"The seasons turn eternally,
And we vanish like the stars,
Yet spring will always come again,
Bringing with it the promise of life."

Fade to black.
