	[If possible, I'd like to have cursed items, that cannot be removed, which would serve as his claw and Alutha's final
	sword, Frey.  (Yes, there are two Freys, one can be found in the Joyous Day, the other starts on Alutha.  With Victor
	though, because he can't get anything new for a while, I think it might be cool if we have plot events change his
	item...if we can do this, I'd like him to gain +5 for killing Evil Tree (+5 attack), +5 more for beating the boss of
	the sewers, +5 more for beating Ryan.)]
