Level indicates the level adjustment factor based off of the average level of party members when the character joins.  Hence, if Connor is level 3 when Ryan joins, Ryan will be level 4.  He will then gain all stat increases that he would get for level
4 added to his starting stats.  That way, we don't have to guess what level the player will be when a char joins.

P indicates primary stat
S indicates secondary

I would do it like this:
P increase = 6 + (0 to 2)
S increase = 4 + (0 to 2)
Other inc  = 0 + (1 to 6)

That way, you don't always gain the exact same in your primary and secondary

		HP	SP	STR	END	AGL	WIS		LEVEL
Connor		51	20	11P	11	7	10S		0
Ryan		45	10	9S	10	13P	8		+1
Elya		35	30	5	7S	5	14P		-1
Victor		85	10	20P	35	20S	5		0
Roland		65	10	15P	12S	10	5		+2
Alutha	        95	20	20P	12S	10	10		+2

I would do HP gained per level as (4*End/5) to (5*End/4)
I don't know what the max level will be in the game, but at level 20, that gives the highest possible HP gained by someone
who has gained the max END every level to be 100. Lowest, then, would be 64.  It sets the spread for Connor on level 1to
be 8 to 10.  It's a pretty wide spread, we can narrow it if you like.  Also, if you want it to go up faster, we can do that too.

SP increase would be the same, divided by 3.  That way, most chars won't go crazy with tons of MP by the end of the game.
