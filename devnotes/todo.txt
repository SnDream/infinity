- make everybody surprised when the king mentions that kraith can bring back the unnamed in alutha event
- change to ship music when ryan comes to the rescue after alutha castle
- remove ryan debug character in magi cave
- disable usage of sacrifice if connor is only character alive
- require a weapon to be equipped to use weapon skills (ie longshot)

bug reports:
- battle cursor lockon will go to a different guy if you make a move too fast (not fatal, but looks strange)
- gems in battle sometimes mess the menu icons (see other gem bugs)
- You can enter the castle after having gotten Ryan, but no one will speak to you and the
  king is absent.  This apparently happened in Alutha as well.  Strange!
- ryan can't use items at the beginning?
- sell menu doesn't show correct values on initial draw.
- lifedolls don't seem to be reviving me, but they are getting removed from inventory (this is in battle)
- sometimes using mycelia in battle causes them to be removed from inventory but not actually used
- window palette gets jacked during palette effects in battle.
- it's possible to walk one way and face another if you turn fast enough
- connor did a side-step when right button is hit after stepping out of bed
- Down-left slash shot out down-right instead...not sure why
- Exanima's palette is all screwy when she moves.
- command ring palette problem
- wrong on-map graphic for yeti (it's the zombie)
- wrong battle graphic for yeti (it's the wolf again)
- can't see damage when dying
- bug on screen when dying
- ryan sometimes skips using an item
- lifedoll in battle crashes game??
- um... the little mage killed exanima by casting cure on her... i don't think that was supposed to happen...
- victor and sword palette got screwed up after a critical hit in battle
- you seem to lose your ship after getting it if you enter firecave or north pass
- the color of the "new game" window is the window color of the last game played
- cycling around the tabs in the subscreen for awhile will mess up the graphics

what-ifs:
- can get on boat at Tower of Magi during visit?
- what happens if the player goes to the mountain pass instead of kassim?
- can elya get on the boat by herself if she walked back to it before the trials?
- it's not obvious that the player needs to go through the fire cave again. what happens if the player goes to the forest?

suggestions:
- mat: infinity logo during prophecy?
- alpha 4 golem should stop moving after battle if you win
- mark: let dead party members earn xp
- mark: enemy magic seems too strong. problem is we only have 1 stat for both magic def and magic strength. reduce magic damage from enemies by 15%?
- mark: running should be easier. 25% minimum rate? (though that'd be 100% with 4 characters..)
- mark: increase cost of items at kassim?
- mark: only allow selling 1 water? or allow water to be used in combat?
- mark: I wonder if we should change the months' names for fantasy?
- mark: seems weird to be able to just waltz into king's bedroom
- mark: transitions between rooms could be faster
- mark: remove long gaps between sentences in the prophecy scene
- shops should indicate who can equip what
- consider having some areas not use the battle music (noticed this in crono trigger and it's kinda cool)

observations:
- inns all cost 15 au?
- when elya is charmed, some frames have holes
- charm graphics appear on top of battle menu
- are we using the right mountains in the prophecy scene?
- You cannot see movement circles on snow backgrounds.  Big problem.
- The way character numbering works seems odd...ie, I select "Embrace'...Elya
  (#4) is the target.  I press down, Ryan (who is #3) is the target.  I hit down
  again, Connor (#1) is the taget...what's going on?
- quake affects the bird
- the cave to the east of Holbrook is inactive (nothing happens when you walk on it)
- fire cave: is the chest in the lava room accessible?
- sending the player through the fire cave 3 times is pretty ridiculous
- roland starts with all skills which is probably wrong
- after the trials, the boy in the first room says this is the treasury which is probably wrong?
- moonstone should probably ask you if you want to warp. also some maps need to disable it.
- to elya, is the magi tower inpregnable or inpenetrable??

final checklist:
- make sure wolf victor can't equip anything except gems
- make sure you can't buy an item if you have 100
- make sure you can't open a chest containing an item if you have 100
- level cap works?
- all enemies have casting frames?
- every chest filled?
- every shop filled?
- gems in the correct places too?
- all enemies in the game?
- make sure shops sell the right stuff
- make sure all skills are team reversable
- make sure all skill damage are modified based on strength/weakness attributes (note: bcalcmod())
- make sure all battle speeds work properly
- make sure items have the right names
- make sure soulslurp looks correct
- make sure all weapon skills (ie longshot) require a weapon to be equipped
- make sure enemies can't attack dead characters
- make sure it's not possible to run from the golem fights in kassim except for the boss
- make sure it's not possible to beat the golem boss at kassim other than running
- make sure skills are given away at the correct places
- make sure gems are given away at the correct spots in the game
- make sure gems are all functional
- make sure music is used in the correct places
- make sure sfx is used in the correct places
- make sure items are sprinkled in maps
- make sure talking to a moving townsperson that triggers and event correctly executes the event
- make sure there are no debug features in the final game
- make sure you can't use moonstone in situations where you shouldn't be able to warp
- make sure gem charge decreases based on battle speed
- make sure ailments wears off based on battel speed
